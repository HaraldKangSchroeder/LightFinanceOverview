This is a private project of mine and is used for a light overview of financial incomes and outcomes.

## Setup

1. The application comes along with Docker, specifically with docker-compose.\
You need to install those first -
see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

2. Execute `docker-compose up` to start the application (append `-d` flag to start in detached mode). This might take a couple minutes.

3. The application then runs on port 8123
